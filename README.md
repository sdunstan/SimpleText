SimpleText
==========

Objective-C builder for creating attributed text strings.

This is not yet working software.

## TODO:
 1. Finish PoC.
 1. ~~Write user manual. Documentation will drive API.~~
 1. Integrate BDD style tests (Kiwi?)
 1. Refactor the builder to build string ranges and apply styles at build time.
 1. Implement styles (bold, italics, etc)

See Wiki for documentation.
