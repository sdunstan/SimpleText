SimpleText
==========

Objective-C builder for creating attributed text strings.

This is not yet working software. (But it is getting there!)

## TODO:
 1. ~~Write [user manual](://github.com/sdunstan/SimpleText/wiki). Documentation will drive API.~~
 1. ~~Integrate BDD style tests (Kiwi)~~
 1. Finish sample app.
 1. Implement styles (bold, italics, etc.)
 1. Better font handling.

See [Wiki](://github.com/sdunstan/SimpleText/wiki) for documentation.
